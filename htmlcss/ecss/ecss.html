        <h1>MULLAPERIYAR ISSUE</h1>
</li>
        <ol>
<li class="purple">A lease indenture for 999 years was made on 29-10-1886 between Maharaja of Travancore and Secretary of State for India for Periyar irrigation works.  By another agreement in 1970, Tamil Nadu was permitted to generate power also. The Mullaperiyar Dam was constructed during 1887-1895. Its full reservoir level is 152 ft and it provides water through a tunnel to Vaigai basin in Tamil Nadu for irrigation benefits in 68558 ha area.
In 1979, reports appeared in Kerala Press about damage to Periyar Dam.</li>

<li class="violet">On 25th November, 1979 Chairman, CWC held meeting with the officers of Irrigation and Electricity, Deptt. Of Kerala and PWD of Tamil Nadu and some emergency medium term measures and long-term measures for strengthening of  Mullaperiyar Dam were decided. 
A second meeting under the Chairmanship of Chairman, CWC was held on 29th April 1980 and it was opined that after the completion of emergency and medium term measures, the water level in the reservoir can be raised up to 145 ft.
The matter became sub judice with several petitions.</li> 

<li class="blue">On the directions of the Supreme Court in its order dated 28.4.2000, Minister (WR) convened the Inter-State meeting on 19.5.2000 and as decided in the meeting, an Expert Committee under Member (D&R), CWC with representatives from both States was constituted in June 2000 to study the safety of the dam. The Committee in its report of March, 2001 opined that with the strengthening measures implemented, the water level can be raised from 136 ft. To 142 ft. without endangering safety of the dam. Further raising of water level to 152 ft. would be considered after balance strengthening measures are implemented.
</li>
<li class="cyan">The Supreme Court in its orders on 27.2.2006, permitted the Government of Tamil Nadu to raise the water level of Mullaperiyar dam from 136 ft. 
To 142 ft. and to carry out the remaining strengthening measures. 
</li><li class="lightblue">
    After that the Government of Kerala passed the Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act 2006 on 18th March 2006 which prohibited the raising of water level beyond 136 ft. in the Mullaperiyar Dam and placed it in the Schedule of ‘Endangered Dams’.
Government of Tamil Nadu filed a suit in the  Supreme Court on 31.3.2006 praying for declaration of above Act as unconstitutional in its application to and effect on Mullaperiyar Dam and restraining the State of Kerala from obstructing Tamil Nadu to increase the water level to 142 feet.
The Union Minister (WR) convened an inter-State meeting of the Chief Ministers of States of Tamil Nadu and Kerala on Mullaperiyar dam issue on 29.11.2006 at New Delhi. Both States reiterated their respective stand in the meeting  and no consensus could be reached regarding a solution acceptable to both States.
